# Dutch_Renaissance_corpus

This corpus contains alexandrines and iambic pentameters written by a selection of Dutch Renaissance poets (end of 16th and 17th century). 
Its creation and annotation was part of a PhD project at the Meertens Institute (https://www.meertens.knaw.nl) which was funded by the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen (KNAW).

All texts have been taken from the Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren (https://www.dbnl.org).

Most of the corpus has been automatically annotated and the lines marked with an asterisk have been manually annotated or checked.
